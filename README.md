# art-ificial-intelligence

This is a master's project in advanced machine learning with neural networks. We investigated using CycleGANs for generating art of different styles, compared different architectures and improved upon the original U-Net structure. In the comparison between different painters, we investigated which styles were the most difficult to reproduce and why.
