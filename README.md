# art-ificial-intelligence

This is a masters programme course project (not my thesis) in advanced machine learning with neural networks. We investigated using CycleGANs for generating art of different styles, compared different architectures and improved upon the original U-Net structure. In the comparison between different painters, we investigated which styles were the most difficult to reproduce and why.
